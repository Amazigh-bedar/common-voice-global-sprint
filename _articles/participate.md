  * Go to the <a href="{{ '/register/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Registration</a> page and look for an event in your area
  * Click on the event you are interested in and you will be redirected to the signup page for that event
  * If there is no event in your area, consider <a href="{{ '/host/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">hosting</a> one yourself :)

  ### Do the action solo

  You prefer to participate at the campaign from the comfort of your couch? Thatâ€™s totally fine! Here is how:

  * Install [Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org) for Desktop
  * Check the [Alexa list](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries) of the most famous websites in your local area and choose the website you want to test. Please don't start at the top to make sure we do not only test the top 10.
  * Once you have finished testing a website go and [report it on the report form]({{ '/reporting/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), you will find all the info you need on how to report your work
  * Keep doing the awesome work and make Firefox better!
